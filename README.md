# Taskie: An AI-Assisted iOS Task Management App

## Project Overview
Taskie is a task management iOS app developed with the power of AI assistance. This project represents my first foray into iOS development, Swift programming, and working with Xcode. Despite being new to these technologies, I was able to bridge the gap between conceptual understanding and practical implementation through the use of advanced AI tools.

## Development Process
The entire development process was guided by two primary AI assistants:
1. ChatGPT (GPT-4)
2. Claude AI

These AI tools were instrumental in:
- Explaining iOS and Swift concepts
- Providing code snippets and examples
- Offering step-by-step guidance for using Xcode
- Troubleshooting and debugging issues
- Suggesting best practices and design patterns

## Key Features
- Real-time task updates using Combine framework
- Automatic categorization of tasks (today's tasks vs. pending tasks)
- Task completion tracking
- Task history with cleanup mechanism (keeps last 20 completed tasks)


## Technologies Used
- Swift
- Xcode
- SwiftUI, Core Data, etc.

## Challenges and Learning
As a newcomer to iOS development, I faced numerous challenges:
- Understanding Swift syntax and iOS-specific programming concepts
- Navigating Xcode and its various features
- Implementing UI/UX designs in an iOS environment
- Debugging and resolving iOS-specific errors

However, with the assistance of AI, I was able to overcome these hurdles and gain practical experience in iOS app development.

## Reflections
This project demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted learning and development. It showcases how AI tools can empower newcomers to rapidly prototype and build functional applications, even in unfamiliar technological landscapes.

While AI provided significant assistance, the process still required human creativity, problem-solving, and decision-making. This project represents a synergy between human ideas and AI-powered implementation.

## Future Improvements
- Planning to add continues reminders for pending tasks via notifications.
- Widget feature so that it can display the current and pending task on the homescreen.
